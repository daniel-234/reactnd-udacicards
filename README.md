# UdaciCards Project

The third and last project in the React Nanodegree course is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called 'decks', add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Getting Started

This project has been created usning `create-react-native-app`.
To install the application, you can (fork and) download it and then run the command `npm install` from your console. To launch it, after the installation has successfully complete, launch it with the command `npm start`.
`yarn` can be used in place of `npm`.

## Built With

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - A framework for building native apps using React
* [Genymotion Android Emulator](https://www.genymotion.com/) - An easy and very powerful Android emulation platform for app developers and testers

## Notes

IMPORTANT: This project has just been started and the code you are looking at is still incomplete.

Why this project? This app has been created as the final project for the React Nanodegree at Udacity and encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing and user input. By building it, students of the [React Nanodegree Program at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) will gain an understanding of how to use react Native to build an iOs and Android application.
Although the emulation platform is not strictly speaking a building tool, I included it because of its importance in this work.
IMPORTANT: This app has only been tested on an Android device (a Samsung S6, through an emulator) and not on any iOS phone or emulation platform.
